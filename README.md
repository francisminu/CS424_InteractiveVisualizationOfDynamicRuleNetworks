# CS424_InteractiveVisualizationOfDynamicRuleNetworks
Create an interactive web visualization that automatically creates "site graphs" corresponding to the data given (Protein Interactions)


 CS424- Interactive visualization of dynamic rule networks 
The project helps in creating Site graphs, modelling the influences among rules at different time intervals. This helps in visualizing how a rule affects the other in the system and how that influence changes over time. The challenging part lies in creating a clutter-free visualization due to its volume. The data set is huge and is subjected to increase as well. This motivated us to choose matrix visualization as it avoids clutter and helps in providing a clear view of changes in data. To compare the influences, we are making use of Parallel Coordinates which delivers a clean visualization to mark noticeable changes like positive influence turning negative etc,.

Our main visualization task:
1.	Interactive web visualization that automatically creates "site graphs" from a JSON file.
Our layout can effectively manage highly complex site graphs so that visual clutter (e.g., link crossings, color choices) is mitigated as much as possible. 
2.	To display the influence of particular rules describing a biochemical system changes over time.
3.	The comparison of Rules which has similar influences is showed in form of cluster.
4.	Comparison of rules over a period of times can be easily seen together in one visualization of Time Line

Instructions on How to Download & Run the project:
1.	Download the entire Project
2.	Clear history in the Browser before running the project
3.	Reduce the screen Zoom to 50% for better visualization effects
4.	Run the File matrix.html on your server.
